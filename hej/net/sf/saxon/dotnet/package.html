    <title>Package overview for net.sf.saxon.dotnet</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This package provides classes that interface Saxon to the .NET platform.</p>

<p>These classes are used only in the .NET version of Saxon; they are not present
    in the version for the Java platform.</p>

<p>Most of these class encapsulate a .NET class in a wrapper that implements a Java interface:
    either an interface defined in the JDK specifications, or a Saxon-defined interface.
    For example, DotNetInputStream wraps a .NET Stream as a Java InputStream, while a DotNetPullProvider
    wraps an XMLReader as a Saxon PullProvider. This enables the .NET service to be used
    as a functional substitute for Java code implementing the same interface.</p>

<p>The instantiation of these classes is generally controlled through the Platform object
    registered with the Configuration, which has one instance for the Java platform and another
    for the .NET platform.</p>
